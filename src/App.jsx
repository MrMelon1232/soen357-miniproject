        In most cases, Access uses Text Box controls to display Short Text or
        Long Text fields. However, when you add a Long Text field to a view in
        an Access web app, Access creates a Multiline Textbox. When using a
        Multiline Textbox in the browser, you can press Enter to move to a new
        line in the textbox. If you’re in a datasheet, you’ll need to use the
        scrollbars to see anything below the first line. In Desktop databases,
        if a Long Text field is configured to show Rich Text, and you add that
        field to a form or report, Access automatically applies the Rich Text
        setting to the text box.In most cases, Access uses Text Box controls to
